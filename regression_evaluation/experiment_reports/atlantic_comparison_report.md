# Fill vs Adjacent Values Comparison

The bar plot below illustrates the comparison between the "Fill" and "Adjacent" experiments across four different scenarios: `full`, `no emm`, `no mf7`, and `no emm/mf7`. Each scenario is represented on the x-axis, with two corresponding bars indicating the values for "Fill" (in blue) and "Adjacent" (in orange).

This visualization helps in understanding the variations in "Fill" and "Adjacent" metrics under different conditions, with positive and negative values clearly differentiated by the horizontal line at y=0.

# Fill vs MF7 Values Comparison 

The bar plot below illustrates the comparison between the "Fill" experiments and using MF7 values to fill in missing values in magnetic anomaly data.
