# Fill vs Adjacent Values Comparison

The bar plot below illustrates the comparison between the "Fill" and "Adjacent" values across four different scenarios: `full`, `no emm`, `no mf7`, and `no emm/mf7`. Each scenario is represented on the x-axis, with two corresponding bars indicating the values for "Fill" (in blue) and "Adjacent" (in orange).

This visualization helps in understanding the variations in "Fill" and "Adjacent" metrics under different conditions, with positive and negative values clearly differentiated by the horizontal line at y=0.
