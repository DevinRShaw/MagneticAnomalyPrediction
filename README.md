# Magnetic Anomaly Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict magnetic anomaly grids using geophysical predictor grids. This is a crucial component of the MagNav project, which develops a military-grade navigation algorithms based on magnetic navigation. Due to the lack of quality magnetic data, we leverage machine learning to enhance the accuracy of magnetic anomaly predictions. The end objective of improving magnetic estimations is to improve the performance of the MagNav project.
